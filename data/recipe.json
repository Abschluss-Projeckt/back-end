    "description": [
      "Add 00 flour, whole wheat flour, and dry yeast to a large bowl. Mix with a whisk until combined. Add the lukewarm water. Mix with a rubber spatula until no dry flour is visible. The dough will be relatively moist at this point. Drizzle the surface with a little olive oil, then cover with a kitchen towel or dough cover and leave to rise in a warm place. After approx. 1.5 – 2 hrs, the volume should have doubled and you can continue with step 2. Alternatively, you can leave the dough in the fridge to slowly rise overnight to further develop flavor and get an even puffier result.",
      "Dust a work surface with flour. Tip the dough out of the bowl, fold each side into the centre to trap in some air and turn it over. Use flour as needed to help handle the dough (this will depend on how wet your dough is), but use sparingly. Divide the dough into four equal parts using a dough cutter. Fold each of these pieces using the same method as above. Place each dough ball seam-side down and shape into a firm ball using the edges of your hands and moving in a circular motion. Now either store, individually wrapped, in the fridge for up to 3 days (take out 1 hr. before baking), store in the freezer for up to 3 months (take out at least 8 hrs. before baking) or leave to rest on the work surface for approx. 1 hr. (if you’re in an absolute hurry, you could reduce this resting time) and use immediately.",
      "In the meantime, preheat the oven to the highest setting on the top/bottom heat function and place an inverted baking sheet on the lowest shelf. Once the oven is preheated and the rising time is over, shape each dough ball into a pizza: Flour the work surface and use your fingertips to flatten the ball from the inside out, leaving a thick edge. Use flour as needed. Once your palm can fit in the centre, lift the dough up and use gravity, stretching gently. to help you form a larger pizza. Place on a sheet of parchment paper, which, if you have one, you can place on top of a pizza paddle.",
      "Top your pizza with whatever you like best. I like to use canned tomatoes mixed with fresh garlic, salt and a little olive oil as a base and then add buffalo mozzarella and basil after baking. It’s best not to use too much sauce, 1.5 – 2 tablespoons are usually enough, and be sure to transfer your pizza in the oven with the baking paper immediately after topping so that the raw dough doesn't draw in too much liquid. As soon as the pizza has baked through, after approx. 3 – 4 min., carefully remove the parchment paper from underneath and finish baking the pizza. Keep baking for approx. 8 – 12 min. (the timing will depend on your oven) until your crust is browned. Repeat the process with the remaining dough. If you like, finish with some lemon zest and freshly grated Parmesan.",
